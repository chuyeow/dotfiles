# Chu Yeow's dotfiles

My dotfiles, inspired by [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Installation

```
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

The [script/bootstrap](script/bootstrap) script sets things up by symlinking
files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory. Everything lives within
`~/.dotfiles`.

## OS X defaults

Set up OS X the way I like it:
```
./osx/set-defaults.sh
```
